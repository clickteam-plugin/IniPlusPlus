Note: Run_Only can be smaller, but won't be in this release. I will make it smaller when the chart function is added.

08:54 24/10/2007

===============

Beta 4a

1) New Feature: Now you are forcably stopped from modifying data on the 'On Data Modified' event. A dialog box explains to you why and gives you the chance to quit.

2) The index is much better respected now. (It was ignored in a few cases, and mixed up in other cases.)

3) New action: "Find Subgroups"

4) Subgroups are now supported by 'Load' and 'Save'. They work as follows. In the Ini++ object themselves they are represented as paths like 'group/subgroup'. Now when 'Load and Save Subgroups' is enabled, the following two things happen:

	a) The 'Load' function will automatically name subgroups correctly if they are indented. For instance:

		[hello]
		a = b
			[subgroup]
			c = d
		e = f

	Will be loaded as if it were:

		[hello]
		a = b
		e = f
		[hello/subgroup]
		c = d

	b) Save will save groups in the form [a/b] in that form.

	Both handle groups within groups within groups within groups within... (etc.)

5) Text for 'Set repeat mode' has all three parameters now.

6) Now you can set 'Auto load' at runtime (using the 'Set Auto Load/Save' action)

04:09 27/09/2007

========================


Beta 3ii mark 2: Made On Merge work. 01:05 27/09/2007

Beta 3i

1) Much leaner "Run_Only_Small" mode, as all the unused resources have been removed.
  (From ~360Kb to 255Kb, which is quite low when you think this doesn't use Win32 functions to do the work)
	[NOTE: THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE NOT YET VISIBLE AS 'RUN_ONLY_SMALL' IS NOT INCLUDED]

2) French display mode

3) Export to CVS, Write as CVS String and Import CVS functions.

4) Now the case of groups and items are saved. This updates many functions. 

5) SetCaseSensitivity has been completely rewrittien.

6) AutoSave was not requested from CopyGroup sometimes.

7) New 'AutoLoad' opition. Off by default.

8) 'Chart' action put in but of course it doesn't do anything yet.

02:13 26/09/2007

==========================

Beta 3h

1) Now there are alt strings, values and flags.
2) New "Max and Min" expression.
3) "On Data Change" is called from the tree again, that was a bug.
4) New functions for getting items and values in sorted order.

Included is an example to show how easy (4) makes custom high score tables.

01:44 25/09/2007

==========================

Beta 3g

1) Icon changed in message box
2) New mode added for final combination: IAvg/~~/#. Second param only. Sums the values and then divides by total number of items in the object. Use + as the first parameter and this as the second and you will get overall average.
3) Two dialog box bugs fixed:
	a. Enter didn't open dialog box unless cursor was over item
	b. Delete would delete group '0'.

11:16 24/09/2007

===========================

Beta 3f

1) New expression: "Generalised Inner Product". Really needs renaming!

n	count		(item only)
+	add
*	multiply
max	max
min	min
~	average


2) Now a new file isn't created if the checkbox isn't checked in the opition pane. This was a feature a few versions ago, but it was a rubbish feature.

Also, an included example of how to use it.

06:47 24/09/2007

==============================

Beta 3e

1) Bug fix: "On Modified" event called less.
2) To make the dialog faster, auto-refresh doesn't resort.
3) Added a 'mode' opition to the refresh action.
4) Now the ordering of the internal Ini puts numbers ahead.
5) Memory leaks fixed:
	a. SaveToFile
	b. The edit box from the tree
	c. There could be one left in the LoadObject routine!
6) SaveObject and SaveGlobals both pause Autosave now.
7) Slightly different description to that check box on the dialog box settings parameter screen.

Not yet done: Still doesn't remember the case of key and group names.

12:36 24/09/2007

==============================

Beta 3d

1) Dialog: Too many items being created bug (Nova #1) fixed

2) Dialog: New display mode: ITEM_COLON_VALUE 6

3) Dialog: REFRESH_ON_NEW mode removed (useless and buggy)

4) Dialog: New groups are now created expanded.

5) New "Close Dialog" and "Refresh Dialog" actions.

6) New events: On Merge, On Search Results, On No Search Results.

7) Brand new dialog for the 'Open Dialog' action which makes everything so easy. 
   (Check out the tooltip too which tells you all the opitions in a list.)

01:04 24/09/2007

================

Beta 3c

1) Ini++ shared data is now shared with the sub app

2) Now more than one Ini++ object can use the share data at
   a time. The settings are respected for:
	- All actions, conditions and expressions
	- The debugger
	- They technically aren't in the debugging dialog,
	  the none of the settings make a difference anyway.

3) Lots of bug fixes, all the same bug. I did something very
   silly. But it would cause the tree to crash when there were
   very large numbers of items, for instance, so that is fixed
   now.

4) The SearchResults structure wasn't deleted, opps.

5) The "Select Object" dialog has changed a bit (still
   not really what I want, but going to have to wait til
   a patch for that I think). Also, it now disallows you
   merging or saving into an object if it shares data with
   it (for that doesn't make sense).

6) New "On New Item" condition

7) Tree changes:
	-> Right clicking the icon now counts as right clicking an item (so the menu reacts)
	-> A new auto-refresh mode. Whenever the Ini object is modified, it updates the labels of every item
	-> A new opition to disable the above: NO_AUTO_REFRESH = 256
	-> A new opition to do a full refresh upon adding a new item: REFRESH_ON_NEW = 512.
	-> The code has been sorted out a bit

For interest, here is my "To Do" list which I've decided I won't do now:
	a. Conditions for "Item has value...". I tried and it didn't work for some reason.
	b. Full autorefresh which figures out if there are new items or groups smoothly
	c. The ability for the dialog to be a control on the window

05:33 20/09/2007

=================

Beta 3b

1) New events related to dialog box:
	On Open
	On Close
	On Modified

2) New general events:
	On Data Modified
	On Save

3) 'Standard Ini' checkbox has been relabelled, hopefully to
   be clearer now that the setting aren't collapsed.

4) Adding folders to the tree should be better now

5) When ran from MMF, the default path is that of the MFA file now. If the
   file is unsaved, it uses the temp directory of the EXE. The property 
   editor also makes it more clear that it only uses the _inital_ current 
   folder.

6) Now, if that title check box next to 'Load File' isn't checked then the
   file name is used but the file is not loaded. (IS THIS OK?)

7) Now, the inital data is loaded into the object before the file is loaded
   (if there is a file to be loaded). As soon as the file is loaded, it will
   be saved again (if auto save is on).

8) A new opition to save repeated items (i.e. those in form 'Item_name.*')
   as the original item ('Item_name'). This applies to groups as well and
   can result in there being repeated items or groups in the Ini file.

   [ Note: Although these functions do mean that repeated items can be loaded
   and saved correctly, in memory there still cannot be multiple items with
   the same name. However, if the repeat mode is set to 'rename' they will
   be renamed in the form 'Item_name.#', where # is a number, so that the
   save setting works ]


NOTE ON ON_CLOSE:
  when it is closed from either the debugger or by going to the next frame,
   there is no close message. But if you open one replacing another, there 
  *will* be a close message. (although the new 'open' message will be first)

12:05 18/09/2007


=================


Beta 3a

1) Updated to use new SDK

2) Filters in all parameters which take file names are now specified

3) Global values and strings can now be saved and loaded

4) Bug fix: Ini data was not being freed!

5) New setting: Global data. As you might suppose, every Ini++
   which has this setting keeps the data global. This is good
   if you want to keep data internal but across frames.
   
   It should be noted that it is only the data itself which is
   shared. The settings are not. However, for all except one the
   data is independant of the settings, and that is the case
   sensitive setting. If it is on one frame but not on the other
   will result in the whole Ini file be made case insensitive,
   and so data lose may occur.

   Only one Ini++ object may access the global data on one frame.
   This is enforced with a popup window in edit mode. The object
   will just fail to be created in run only mode.
   (The reason for it is that the settings on the latter one would
   not be respected, and it'd require to much reprogramming to 
   change that, whilst nobody will want two objects on the same
   frame anyway). 

The example has also been updated to use global data instead of a temporary Ini file.

10:53 16/09/2007

==============



Beta 2c

1) Menu does not fold anymore. Better or worse?

2) New action: Add Repeated Item. Adds a repeated item (or group). This will
   set a value without every overwriting the old value. The opition specifies
   whether it does this by adding new groups or new items. The new items will
   be the old one with .n at the end, where n is the smallest number such that
   the group didn't previously exist..

3) New parameter to "Set Current Group" asks if you want to ensure it is new.
   As above, if the original exists then it goes for the old one with .n appended
   to it, where n is the smallest number such that the group didn't previously
   exist. (Does this just complicate things?)

4) In the tree, the right click menu now respects the disallow delete group and
   disallow delete item opitions more faithly. (Previously it just didn't show
   it if either opition was set)

5) Bug fix: AutoSave was completely broken!

6) Tree refreshes better in a few cases

7) Delete key and enter keys work on tree

The example is updated to include a level editor which uses "Add Repeated Item"

03:29 16/09/2007

===============

Beta 2b

1) The tree update is better (it only deletes everything and remakes it all if you rename a group)

2) Only one dialog can be shown at a time now. The old one will automatically close.

3) The 'display mode' for items in the tree can be set to one of 6 styles. These are:

	Number		Name			Example
	==============================================================
	0		INI Display		data = 'value'
	1		Item Only		data
	2		Bracket Display		data ('value')
	3		Value Only		'value'
	4		English Style 1		Item 'item' has value 'value'
	5		English Style 2		Item: 'item', Value: 'value'

4) Tree dialog now has right click menus with: Refresh, Delete, Add Group, Add Item.

5) New settings for dialog box: 
	NO_REFRESH: Disallows the refresh button			 32
	NO_ADD_GROUP: Disallows the adding of groups			 64
	NO_ADD_ITEM: Disallows the adding of items			128
	
	(Therefore, DEBUG_MODE_TITLE is renumbered to 1024)

	[Note: When the dialog box pauses MMF, NO_REFESH is automatic.]

Also, I've included an example.

01:12 16/09/2007

======

Beta 2a

1) Now the new tree view is always on top

2) The items in the tree menu have a slightly different icon (Looking for 16x16 icons for that)

3) Both debugging dialog boxes may now be resized (after taking more than an hour to notice I'd forgotten a 'break')

4) The tree view now allows editting and deleting of groups and items. It does not allow new items to be added.

5) A new action: 'Open dialog', for lazy editing.
For the settings,Add any of these numbers together:

No delete button for groups		 1
No delete button for items		 2
Groups may not be renamed		 4
Item names may not be renamed		 8
Item values may not be changed		16

(Note: Groups can still be removed by removing all items in a group if 2 is set)

Note:
- Opening more than one at a time causes settings to
  change to that of the last opened for all of them.
- If more than one is open, they will not all be
  kept updated to each others changes
- If the frame changes, there will be a crash
- If the data otherwise changes, it will not be updated

6) There is now a brief description of the object. Is it okay?

7) I've tried to make the capitalisation of 'Ini' consistant.
Is this Joshtek's 4 or is there more?

8) Joshtek's points 6 and 7 have been changed. However, there are
still lots of cases where action information doesn't state everything.
Tell me if you notice any specific examples!
